Hackathon Brief - Yachtdrop Online
Chandlery
Overview
Today you’ll build a mobile-first online chandlery marketplace that lets yacht crews order
parts and supplies for delivery directly to their boat in the marina or request pickup.
This is not a traditional e-commerce website.
It should feel like using a native mobile app, but run entirely in the browser.
Think: App experience. Website delivery.
Product source: nautichandler.com
Brand & destination: yachtdrop.com
UX inspiration: Uber Eats app / website
